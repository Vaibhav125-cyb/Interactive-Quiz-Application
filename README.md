Interactive Quiz Application: Understanding the Concept:
The interactive quiz application is an advanced project of modern web development created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript aimed at providing users with an engaging learning experience. The application has an intuitive interface with a loading system for questions, a feedback system, a scoring system, and special animations for perfect scores.

Technical Details:
This project, developed entirely using Visual Studio Code, showcases the modern web technologies in use. VS Code's advanced capabilities such as IntelliSense, syntax highlighting, and the integrated terminal greatly assisted in the prompt development of this application. The application makes use of a clean code structure and adheres to best practices, ensuring an appropriate separation of concerns with respect to the technologies in use: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Important Functionalities:
This quiz application offers different quiz categories (General Knowledge, Science, History, and Geography), with each offered five questions. The timer system offers an additional challenge with an answer time limit of 30 seconds per question. The interface offers visual feedback using colour-coded answers, providing green for correct answers and red for incorrect ones, and includes a progress  bar to track progress.

Users who get perfect scores are given a special reward in the form of confetti animations, pulsing score displays, and star effects. The celebration—in addition to the quiz itself—is magnificently handled thanks to the responsive design, which works beautifully on devices ranging from smartphones to desktops. 

Development Process:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a multifaceted IDE equipped with auxiliary functionalities that greatly streamline the development cycle. The live-server plugin enabled me to simultaneously test and make changes to the E-quiz project. The Quick Abbreviations or Emmet snippets, an integral feature of HTML and CSS coding, significantly sped up the construction of the quizzes. The inbuilt JavaScript debugger allowed me to perfect the logic of the E-quiz. The completed project is an HTML file that has no dependencies other than Font Awesome, which is used for the icons.
